# Mirja Holmes Homepage
A little Website for a pseudo plant-photographer called Mirja Holmes that shows her work and gives potentially customers a possibility to get in touch with her. 

Note: I created most parts of this website by taking a HTML5 and CSS3 online course. After finishing the course I changed a few things, but in general it's just one of the workpieces that helped me to learn the basics, and not 100% my own design and implementation. But I think it shows what I learned to code so you get an idea of my skills.
